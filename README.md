# 🌱 CropSmart – Smart Farming with Precision Agriculture

CropSmart is a web-based crop recommendation system that leverages soil composition and environmental factors (like temperature, pH, and rainfall) to suggest the best crops for cultivation using Machine Learning. It aims to empower farmers and agri-enthusiasts with data-driven decisions for higher yield and efficient farming.
